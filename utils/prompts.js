Please follow these instructions exactly:

1. Generate a title that summarizes the topic in 5 words or less.

3. Create a worksheet with exactly ${numQuestions} questions for EACH of the three types: fill-up (fill in the blanks), mcq (multiple-choice), and open_ended. This means you should create a total of ${numQuestions * 3} questions.
4. Distribute a total of ${hardQuestions} hard questions, ${mediumQuestions} medium questions, and ${easyQuestions} easy questions across all types combined.

Output the worksheet in the following JSON format:

{

2. The total number of questions across all types is ${numQuestions * 3}.
3. The questions cover the main points of the given topic or text and are appropriate for ${gradeLevel} grade students.
4. The difficulty levels are distributed appropriately across all question types, totaling ${hardQuestions} hard, ${mediumQuestions} medium, and ${easyQuestions} easy questions.
5. For open-ended questions, provide a comprehensive answer that covers the key points expected in a student's response.

Double-check that you have created the correct number of questions for each type before finalizing your response.
